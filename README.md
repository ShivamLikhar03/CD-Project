3 address code generation for 3d array


Three Address Code Generation for 3D Arrays
Three address code is an intermediate representation used by compilers where each instruction typically has at most three operands. When dealing with array accesses, especially multi-dimensional arrays, address calculation becomes important.

Address Calculation for 3D Arrays
For a 3D array declared as arr[d1][d2][d3], the address of element arr[i][j][k] can be calculated using the following formula in row-major order:

BaseAddress + (((i × d2) + j) × d3 + k) × element_size
Where:

BaseAddress is the starting address of the array
d1, d2, d3 are the dimensions of the array
i, j, k are the indices being accessed
element_size is the size of each element in bytes
